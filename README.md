I have learned typeScript basic. Now I am learning react typeScript. Here, I made a todo app by type script.

How to run?
Clone the repository.
To run the site - 'npm install', then 'npm start'.
Now the website should be up on http://localhost:3000.

I have deployed the site at - https://nervous-babbage-2bc2a7.netlify.app/
